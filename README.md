Learning Python in 2013


These are the Python exercises I did when I was taking the Basics of Programming (Ohjelmoinnin perusteet) course at the University of Oulu, as a part of my bachelor's degree studies. It includes the final assignment of the course, which was to make a Peg Solitaire (a.k.a. Solo Noble) game ('harjoitus.py').
